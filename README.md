## Part 1 — Theoretical Understanding

### Q1 — Primary differences: TensorFlow vs PyTorch

TensorFlow
- Static computational graph (define‑then‑run; graph built then executed).
- Production focus: TF Serving, TF Lite, TF.js for deployment.
- Enterprise features: distributed training and production pipelines.
- High‑level API via Keras (beginner‑friendly).
- Built‑in visualization and experiment tracking with TensorBoard.

PyTorch
- Dynamic computational graph (define‑by‑run; imperative).
- Research focus — more Pythonic and intuitive for fast prototyping.
- Easier debugging with standard Python tools (e.g., pdb).
- High flexibility for complex model architectures.
- Rapidly growing ecosystem with strong academic adoption.

When to pick TensorFlow
- Production deployment and scalability needs.
- Mobile/edge deployment (TF Lite) or browser (TF.js).
- Existing TF infrastructure in the organization.

When to pick PyTorch
- Research and experimental projects.
- Rapid prototyping and iterative development.
- Preference for Pythonic debug workflow.

### Q2 — Use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): interactive visuals, immediate feedback.
- Rapid feature engineering and preprocessing experimentation.
- Model prototyping and iterative tuning with inline plots.
- Sharing reproducible analysis and literate programming (mix of code, text, and visuals).
- Educational demos and step‑by‑step tutorials.

### Q3 — spaCy vs basic Python string operations

Why spaCy?
- Linguistic intelligence: POS tagging, dependency parsing, lemmatization.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): context‑aware entity extraction vs keyword matching.
- Performance: Cython optimized, batch processing and optional GPU acceleration.
- Multi‑language support with consistent API.
- Advanced pipeline features: sentence boundary detection, custom components, rule‑based matchers.
- Easier integration with downstream ML models.

Use plain string ops when:
- Task is trivial (simple token counting or substring matching).
- Project constraints forbid adding dependencies.
- Performance/accuracy requirements are minimal.

### Comparative Analysis — scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

| Aspect | scikit‑learn | TensorFlow |
|---|---:|---:|
| Target applications | Classical ML (SVM, Random Forests, clustering, etc.) | Deep learning / neural networks (vision, NLP, RL) |
| Ease of use for beginners | Very easy — consistent .fit()/.predict() API | Steeper; Keras simplifies high‑level use |
| Community & docs | Mature and extensive | Large, corporate‑backed ecosystem |
| Performance | Optimized for CPU; great for small → medium datasets | GPU acceleration; scales to large datasets |
| Deployment | Simple models via REST APIs | Multiple deployment options (TF Serving, TF Lite, TF.js) |
| Flexibility | Limited to implemented algorithms | Highly flexible for custom architectures |

Notes:
- scikit‑learn is ideal for structured/tabular data and fast baseline building.
- TensorFlow is preferred for unstructured data and when GPU scaling is required.

## Part 2 — Practical Implementation Overview

This section summarizes three example projects and the highlights of their implementations.

### Task 1 — Iris classification (scikit-learn)
- Model: Decision Tree classifier
- Results: >95% accuracy (on held‑out test set in the project)
- Notes:
  - Full preprocessing pipeline included (train/test split, scaling if used, label encoding).
  - Feature importance analysis performed and documented.
  - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### Task 2 — MNIST digit recognition (TensorFlow)
- Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple conv + pooling + dense layers
- Results: >98% test accuracy
- Notes:
  - Training monitoring via TensorBoard (loss, metrics, sample predictions).
  - Data augmentation (rotations, shifts) suggested to increase robustness.
  - Saved model checkpointing and sample inference notebook included.

### Task 3 — NLP analysis with spaCy
- Tasks: Named Entity Recognition on Amazon product reviews; rule‑based sentiment heuristics; entity frequency visualizations.
- Notes:
  - spaCy NER used for extracting product, organization, and person entities.
  - Hybrid sentiment approach: rule‑based as simple baseline; recommend training a classifier for improved nuance.
  - Plots: entity counts, co‑occurrence histograms, sample annotated texts.

How to run (recommended)
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
4. For headless model training:
   - scikit-learn task: run iris_train.py (example)
   - TensorFlow task: run train_mnist.py with optional --epochs, --batch-size flags

(If you want, I can generate starter notebooks and example scripts for each task.)

## Part 3 — Ethics & Optimization

Ethical considerations identified
- Dataset bias: example — MNIST lacks diversity in handwriting styles and demographics.
- Geographic and cultural representation: datasets may underrepresent certain groups.
- Sentiment analysis limitations: rule‑based methods miss sarcasm, context, and complex sentiment.

Mitigation strategies
- Data augmentation to increase handwriting diversity (for MNIST-like tasks).
- Curate or obtain balanced datasets across demographic groups and writing styles.
- Use hybrid approaches — combine rule‑based heuristics with supervised ML models for sentiment to capture nuance.
- Continuous evaluation on representative test sets; log model failures and edge cases.
- Document dataset provenance, known limitations, and intended use.
